# OtaProject 2024

Senshu University School of Network and Information - PROJECT 2024

## Overview

We created a website using Vue.js to showcase OtaProject 2024. The site features a background displaying 3D models
created by project members.
The implementation of an SPA web page has enhanced user experience by reducing wait times associated with page
transitions. By adopting SPA principles, data is asynchronously fetched from the server after the initial page load,
facilitating dynamic content updates without full page reloads.
